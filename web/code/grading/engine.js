    This function is used to grade a users answers to a question.
    argument "answers" is the users answers to the question.
    argument "question" is the question to which the users answers is submitted.

    If called with answers = undefined, the function will return the default grading.
    Default grading is generally (pointsObtained = 0, status = AUTOGRADED),

    Grading differs for code questions (pointsObtained = 0, status = UNGRADED) because the grading cannot be determined
    during answers editing (code file editing), the grading of code question is done during the code-check run (see /api/sandbox/[questionId]/users.js).
